//! AC-009 proving tests (integration): dummy gateway consumes a response over
//! persistent gRPC.
//!
//! This slice selects I-001 (real tonic client/server round trip) and keeps the
//! I-002 persistent-channel test wired. I-001 is the proving test for the RPC
//! contract: a REAL tonic server and a REAL client channel exchange a
//! classification request and receive ranked semantic signals over the wire.
//! The pipeline behind the server is the deterministic classification pipeline
//! (tokenizer -> versioned cache -> single-flight -> ranker over the committed
//! synthetic prototypes) — no Candle model is required for I-001.
//!
//! This slice selects I-005/I-006 (dummy-the AI Gateway semantics): the dummy gateway
//! preserves the session metadata it propagates and consumes the ranked signal
//! then routes OUTSIDE llm-d-sc via its fixed test-only mapping (routing
//! authority stays the AI Gateway). I-008 (multi-turn requests do not reconnect per
//! call) is asserted by I-002 (`channel_reconnect_count == 0`).
//!
//! The proving tests drive a [`llm_d_sc::dummy_gateway::DummyGateway`] client
//! against the real classify server over the persistent channel. The dummy
//! module is intentionally NOT implemented yet, so these tests cannot compile
//! until it exists — that is the expected RED for this slice.
