# llm-d-sc

**Semantic classification for inference routing.** A low-latency Rust service
that turns an incoming request into ranked, versioned semantic signals so an AI
Gateway can route it well. Release `0.1` classifies **prompt complexity**, and
ships `cost` and `sensitivity` taxonomies alongside it. Generic **domain**
classification is the next signal (see [Project status](#project-status)).

## What it is

`llm-d-sc` executes semantic classifiers in the inference request path and
returns ranked, versioned evidence about a request. It is a **signal producer,
not a decision maker**.

![AI Gateway and llm-d-sc: the gateway performs routing and enforcement while llm-d-sc returns semantic classification signals. An incoming request enters the AI Gateway, which sends a classification request to llm-d-sc; llm-d-sc returns ranked semantic signals with confidence scores (the diagram shows the target set of domain, sensitivity, and complexity; release 0.1 serves prompt complexity), and the gateway then applies policy, session stickiness, guardrails, and fallback to select the final model.](docs/images/llm-d-sc-semantic-routing.png)

> The payload above shows the target shape once several signal types are served
> together. Release `0.1` serves one signal per instance, returning ranked labels
> with the classifier, model, tokenizer, and taxonomy revisions that produced
> them. Three taxonomies ship built in (`complexity`, `cost`, `sensitivity`), and
> a custom one can be supplied without rebuilding.

![llm-d-sc: what it IS and what it isn't. llm-d-sc IS a semantic classifier runtime service that executes classifiers to produce signals about a request; built for speed with a long-lived Rust service, resident models, caching and warmup; a pluggable runtime architecture with Candle as the first backend and others such as ONNX or vLLM possible later; a signal producer rather than a decision maker, returning ranked signals with confidence while routing decisions are made by the AI Gateway; safe by design, able to abstain when context is insufficient rather than guess; and observable, exposing metrics for latency, confidence, abstention and cache behaviour. llm-d-sc is NOT a router (it does not choose models or endpoints or apply policy; that is the AI Gateway), not a policy or guardrail engine, not a session or state authority (routing state, stickiness and fallback belong to the AI Gateway), not a general-purpose LLM platform, not a training platform, and not a model lifecycle or management system.](docs/images/llm-d-sc-is-and-isnt.png)

The graphic describes the capability set llm-d-sc is built for. Delivery is
phased, and [Project status](#project-status) says which version each part lands
in.

Routing, policy, session authority, and organisation-wide model lifecycle belong
to the gateway and its control plane. The wire contract enforces the boundary:
the response type has **no route or endpoint field**, by design
([ADR-0001](docs/decisions/0001-no-route-field-in-response.md)).

## Why it exists

Routing an inference request well requires knowing something about it. Performing
that classification inside a gateway couples model residency, tokenizer
versioning, and CPU/GPU scheduling to the data plane.

| Concern | Without a classifier runtime | With `llm-d-sc` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gateway complexity | model loading and warmup in the routing hot path | gateway stays a gateway |
| Classification cost | per-request model work | resident models, versioned result cache |
| Overload behaviour | unbounded queueing inside the data plane | bounded admission, explicit rejection |
| Signal trust | labels with no provenance | every result carries classifier, model, tokenizer, and taxonomy revisions |
| Backend choice | baked in | `ClassifierRuntime` abstraction; Candle is the first backend, not the architecture |

## Quick start

Requires a Rust toolchain and `protoc`.

**1. Materialise a classifier artifact** (ModelCar layout, mounted at `/models`
in a container). This example uses the prompt-complexity classifier:

```bash
./hack/fetch-model --classifier complexity
./hack/fetch-model --list     # every available classifier
```

**2. Classify something.** The bundled CLI runs the same pipeline the service
runs, without needing a server:

```bash
cargo run --release --bin llm-d-sc-classify -- \
  "Prove by induction that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n squared."
```

```text
classifier complexity (4 labels, 48 anchors, taxonomy scr-default-anchors-v1)  loaded in 555 ms

  "Prove by induction that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n squared."
  -> REASONING       1.000  ########################
     COMPLEX        -0.232
     MEDIUM         -0.372
     SIMPLE         -0.400
     margin 1.231   8.8 ms
```

A single-fact lookup ranks the other end of the taxonomy:

```bash
cargo run --release --bin llm-d-sc-classify -- "What is the capital of Portugal?"
```

```text
  -> SIMPLE          1.000  ########################
     MEDIUM         -0.074
     COMPLEX        -0.228
     REASONING      -0.403
     margin 1.074   7.5 ms
```

`complexity` sorts prompts into `SIMPLE`, `MEDIUM`, `COMPLEX` and `REASONING`,
so a caller can send a lookup to a small model and a proof to a large one. The
signal is ranked evidence, never a destination.

**3. Run the service:**

```bash
LLM_D_SC_MODEL_DIR=./artifacts/models/complexity \
LLM_D_SC_CLASSIFIER=complexity \
LLM_D_SC_LISTEN=0.0.0.0:50051 \
  cargo run --release --bin llm-d-sc-server
```

```text
llm-d-sc: bound 0.0.0.0:50051; ModelCar dir ./artifacts/models/complexity;
READY (resident Candle classifier loaded and warmed)
```

The service reports **not ready** until the artifact is validated, the model and
tokenizer are loaded, and a warmup forward has succeeded, so an orchestrator
never routes traffic to a cold instance.

`LLM_D_SC_CLASSIFIER` selects a taxonomy. It accepts a built-in name or a path
to your own definition, and the model directory must match the classifier it was
calibrated against. See [docs/classifiers.md](docs/classifiers.md).

Scores are cosine similarities against labelled anchors, not probabilities. They
are comparable WITHIN one response, which is what makes the margin between the
top two labels meaningful, but they are not calibrated across models or
taxonomies and should not be read as confidence in a statistical sense.

**Optional: semantic result cache.** Off by default, and not even compiled into
the default build. The built-in exact-match cache only reuses a label for the
identical text. The Redis-backed semantic tier is gated behind the
`redis-semantic` cargo feature, so the default build stays dependency-light and
has a declared MSRV of 1.92. To enable it, build with
`--features redis-semantic`, then set `LLM_D_SC_CACHE=redis-semantic` to add an
optional L2 tier behind the exact
cache: on an exact-cache miss, after the prompt is embedded, a semantically
similar prior prompt reuses its stored label instead of re-ranking. (A binary
built without the feature logs a warning and falls back to the exact cache if
`redis-semantic` is requested at runtime.) It requires a running
[Redis Stack](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/install/install-stack/)
(RediSearch) instance and is a best-effort accelerator, not a source of truth: a
slow or unreachable Redis degrades to the normal compute path (fail-open) and
never fails the request.

| Env var | Meaning | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LLM_D_SC_CACHE` | Cache strategy: `exact` or `redis-semantic` | `exact` |
| `LLM_D_SC_REDIS_URL` | Redis Stack URL (e.g. `redis://127.0.0.1:6379`); used only when the strategy is `redis-semantic` | none; required when `redis-semantic` |
| `LLM_D_SC_CACHE_THRESHOLD` | Cosine similarity gate for a semantic hit; higher is safer but reuses less | `0.90` |
| `LLM_D_SC_CACHE_TTL` | Cached-label time-to-live, in seconds | `86400` |
| `LLM_D_SC_CACHE_TIMEOUT_MS` | Per-Redis-operation timeout, in milliseconds | `50` |

To run the live Redis integration tests locally (`#[ignore]`d by default because
they need a real Redis Stack):

```bash
./hack/redis-stack.sh &   # start Redis Stack
REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6379 \
  cargo test --features redis-semantic --test redis_semantic -- --ignored
```

`REDIS_URL` above only configures that test run; the running service reads
`LLM_D_SC_REDIS_URL` instead.

**Interactive playground.** To see the cache behave in a browser, one command
starts Redis Stack (with a clean cache), downloads any missing models, and
serves a local web UI:

```bash
./hack/playground      # then open http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

Pick a classifier (`complexity`, `cost`, or `sensitivity`) from the dropdown,
classify a prompt, then a paraphrase of it: the paraphrase is served as an **L2
semantic hit** (a similar prior prompt's label is reused after embedding), and
re-sending the identical text is an **L1 exact hit** returned in well under a
millisecond. Each classifier keeps its own isolated cache. The dropdown ships
per-classifier example prompts to try. It needs Docker (for Redis Stack) and a
one-time ~90 MB download per model (Python 3 + `huggingface_hub`, installed by
the script if absent); without Docker it still runs, fail-open, with the exact
cache only. Set `LLM_D_SC_CLASSIFIER=complexity` to demo a single classifier.
The playground is built only with `--features playground`, so it never affects
the default build.

Two operational constraints apply when the semantic tier is enabled. Both are
fail-open (they degrade to the normal compute path and never produce a wrong
label), but they are silent, so plan for them:

- **One embedding dimension per Redis instance.** The vector index is created
  lazily with the embedding dimension of the first entry written. A classifier
  whose embeddings have a different dimension, pointed at the same Redis, simply
  gets no L2 benefit (its writes fail to index and its lookups miss). Give
  classifiers with different embedding dimensions separate Redis instances.
- **Keep cache-identity fields comma-free.** Entries are isolated by an identity
  tag built from the classifier id and the model, tokenizer, and taxonomy
  revisions, so one classifier or revision never reuses another's labels. That
  isolation relies on those fields not containing a comma (the tag separator);
  the built-in classifiers and revision fingerprints already satisfy this.

**4. Call it over gRPC.** The bundled gateway stand-in issues a real call over a
persistent channel, consumes the signals, and applies its own test-only policy
afterwards, demonstrating that routing authority stays outside this service:

```bash
cargo test --release --test grpc -- --nocapture
```

A response carries ranked signals and the revisions that produced them, so any
result can be reproduced exactly:

```text
request_id:         "req-1"
classifier_id:      "complexity"
model_revision:     "c5f55ef419d268ba843c544dc00988d1e9878044"
taxonomy_revision:  "scr-default-anchors-v1"
status:             OK
ranked:             [ { label: "SIMPLE",    score:  0.999 },
                      { label: "MEDIUM",    score: -0.074 },
                      { label: "COMPLEX",   score: -0.228 },
                      { label: "REASONING", score: -0.403 } ]
```

Every declared label is ranked, so a caller can read confidence from the margin
between the top two rather than trusting a single answer.

Verification and benchmarking:

```bash
./hack/verify              # fmt, clippy -D warnings, build, unit + local tests
./hack/test-parity         # model-dependent tests against the pinned artifact
./hack/spec-check 0.1-mvp   # evidence ledger: every criterion and test ID
cargo run --release --bin bench-runner   # latency matrix
```

Deployment manifests live in [`deploy/`](deploy/). The container build
([`Containerfile`](Containerfile)) ships **no model**. The classifier arrives as
a separate OCI artifact.

The server handles SIGTERM and Ctrl-C with graceful shutdown. It stops readiness
and new inference admission, then drains accepted requests and worker threads.
`LLM_D_SC_SHUTDOWN_GRACE_SECS` sets the drain limit (default: 25 seconds); keep
it below the Pod's `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` so Kubernetes leaves time
for process exit.

                 ▼
   tokenize → transformer → pooling → normalize → rank
```

An optional semantic (L2) cache tier can sit behind the exact-result cache: on a
miss, once the prompt is embedded, a similar-enough prior prompt returns its
stored label instead of reaching the classifier runtime. It is off by default;
see "Optional: semantic result cache" under [Quick start](#quick-start) above.

Three properties are load-bearing:

1. **The networking runtime is not the model scheduler.** Model forwards execute
   on dedicated inference workers; the request handler only admits work and
   awaits a result.
2. **Overload is explicit.** Beyond the configured admission bound, requests are
   rejected with `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` rather than queued without limit.
3. **Cache identity is versioned.** Keys are BLAKE3 fingerprints over the
   classifier, model, tokenizer, and taxonomy revisions plus a hash of the
   normalized input. It is never the raw prompt, and never reusable across a
   revision change.

`specs/` is the project's **design record**, not scaffolding. Each version owns a
directory containing its problem statement, observable behaviour, non-goals,
acceptance criteria mapped to stable test IDs, failure contract, rollback path,
and per-criterion RED/GREEN evidence. It exists so that what was intended, what
was proven, and what was deliberately deferred are all auditable rather than
folkloric. See
[`docs/research/development-method.md`](docs/research/development-method.md).

Detailed phase definitions live in [`docs/VERSIONS.md`](docs/VERSIONS.md); open
work is tracked as issues.

The evidence ledger is machine-checked, not asserted:

```bash
./hack/spec-check 0.1-mvp             # per-criterion status and pending test IDs
./hack/spec-check 0.1-mvp --promotion # refuses while any required gate is unmet
```

This project treats *"many passing unit tests"* and *"the system is proven"* as
different claims, and the tooling enforces the difference. Current limitations
are recorded in [`docs/known-gaps.md`](docs/known-gaps.md) and tracked as issues.

- commits require a [DCO](https://developercertificate.org/) `Signed-off-by` line
  (`git commit -s`)
- `./hack/verify` must be green
- behaviour claims need tests; performance claims need comparable p50/p95/p99
  evidence with the measurement conditions recorded
- existing test assertions are protected. Weakening one requires an explicit
  argument that the previous contract was wrong
- substantial changes are specification-first (`specs/`)
