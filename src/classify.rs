//! Classification pipeline: typed core, tokenizer -> versioned cache ->
//! single-flight -> deterministic ranker over synthetic prototypes.
//!
//! This module defines the typed classification contract ([`ClassificationInput`],
//! [`ClassificationResult`], [`ClassifyStatus`], [`ClassifyError`]) and the
//! [`ClassifierRuntime`] abstraction the service and Candle backend both
//! implement. The response NEVER carries a route/endpoint field: routing/session
//! authority remains the AI Gateway (AC-010).
//!
//! I-001 (AC-009) pins the RPC contract: a real tonic round trip returns ranked
//! semantic signals over the wire. The Candle model is NOT required for that
//! slice — the [`ClassifyService`] pipeline runs a deterministic classifier (the
//! ranker over the committed synthetic prototypes) after tokenizing with the
//! resident [`Tokenizer`]. The real Candle embedder+ranker path is the
//! [`CandleClassifier`], which implements the same [`ClassifierRuntime`] trait.
//! All inputs are committed offline fixtures, so there is no model download and
//! no runtime forward on the deterministic path.
//!
//! The pipeline deliberately wires the exact-result cache with single-flight
//! coalescing (AC-006/AC-007): identical concurrent requests for the same
//! versioned fingerprint coalesce into ONE deterministic classification, and a
//! cache hit bypasses tokenization/ranking entirely. The cache stores a
//! [`ClassificationResult`], keyed by a blake3 versioned fingerprint.
