//! Bounded handoff between the gRPC handler and a dedicated inference executor.

//! AC-008 / ADR-0002: the model forward must NOT run on a Tokio network worker.
//! A BOUNDED channel (the handoff) sits between the gRPC handler and a dedicated
//! executor thread that performs the forward, returning the result via a
//! oneshot. Queue admission beyond the configured bound is rejected explicitly
//! (resource exhausted); the total of in-flight + queued work never exceeds the

//! Deliberately NOT implemented here (0.20 per VERSIONS.md / ADR-0002): per-job
//! deadlines, queued-request cancellation, load shedding policy, graceful drain,
